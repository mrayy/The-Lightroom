# The-Lightroom

This is an expermintal project created for the application process at Teamlab Japan.
The concept of this room is the psudeo-immersion of visuals, sensory and interaction into a single space. The room consists of basic elements:
- Affectors: audio/light generators that can be added by the user.
- Walls: reflects the behaviour of the room based on the the affectors motion and colors. The shape of the room deforms following the attraction of the affectors.
- Particles: emitted from the walls represented the effect of attraction towards the affectors.

The perspective of the rooms is changed based on user's head position, which is tracked using a webcamera. The rendering is done using off-axis projection, simulating looking-through a window.
