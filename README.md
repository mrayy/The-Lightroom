# The-Lightroom
![anim1](http://myamens.com/Uploads/TLR/TLR-intro.gif)

This is an expermintal project created for the application process at Teamlab Japan.
The concept of this room is the psudeo-immersion of visuals, sensory and interaction into a single space. The room consists of basic elements:
- Affectors: audio/light generators that can be added by the user.
- Walls: reflects the behaviour of the room based on the the affectors motion and colors. The shape of the room deforms following the attraction of the affectors.
- Particles: emitted from the walls represented the effect of attraction towards the affectors.

The perspective of the rooms is changed based on user's head position, which is tracked using a webcamera. The rendering is done using off-axis projection, simulating looking-through a window. 

Requirements:
--------
- Leapmotion (In case not available, then set property value "NoLeapmotion" to "true" in the settings file found in: Data\Settings.ini)
- USB Webcamera: Camera index should be set by changing "Index" value in the settings file found in: Data\Settings.ini
 Â  (In case not available, then set property value "NoWebcam" to "true" in the settings file found in: Data\Settings.ini)
- Projector (Optional)

Tested using the following PC: OS Windows 10 Pro, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700, 16GB RAM, NVidia GeForce GTX 1080


How it works:
-------
- The-Lightroom starts by calibrating the placement of the leapmotion using 3 points calibration. The user calibrates by pointing into the points and pinching his hand. If the calibration successeded, then the user should be able to point freely in the 2D space.
- The webcam tracks user's face in order to adjust camera's location. The generated effect is an off-axis projection.
